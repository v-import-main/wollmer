## Description ##
**Flat PM** is an ad management plugin. You might be thinking, "why do I need it?". It's simple: this is the best plugin for organizing ads at a professional level.

You can compare it with plugins like Advanced Ads, Ad Inserter, believe me, it's nothing compared to FlatPM.
If you're worried about front-end performance, then the plugin code is written without using jQuery!

Flat PM has all the functionality, with the exception of GEO, completely free.

This is a new level of advertising management. You can not only create and save ad blocks, but also divide them into folders. Manage general settings for a folder so that you don't have to make changes to each individual ad block.

You can create 3 different types of AB tests.

### The plugin has the following options for displaying ads: ###
* Output based on pixels or the height of the user's screen (a completely unique solution that is not found in other plugins);
* Output based on characters or percentage of your article text;
* Output once, or with repetitions based on css selectors (you are not limited by the content of your article, works without hooks on the backend, very configurable);
* Output of pop-ups and leaving blocks on the left/bottom/right and so on, 9 positions in total;
* Display ads when hovering over an element: images, text, video, and whatever you want;
* Video preroll before watching videos on YouTube, Vimeo.

The plugin does not have any restrictions, it is a fully customizable tool.

### Content targeting options: ###
* Publications;
* Publication types;
* Categories and taxonomies;
* The number of characters and headings in the publication;
* The authors of the publication;
* Types of templates and templates.

### User targeting options: ###

### Additional options: ###
